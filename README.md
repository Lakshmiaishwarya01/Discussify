# Discussify
Social media platform (MERN Full Stack)

Discussify is a full-stack, MERN-based social discussion platform designed to connect individuals with shared interests through structured communities, meaningful discussions, and curated resource sharing.

The application allows users to create accounts, manage profiles, and participate in topic-based communities where they can initiate discussions, engage in conversations, and share articles, videos, and learning resources. Communities can be public or private, enabling controlled collaboration and focused interactions.

The platform emphasizes clean UI/UX, accessibility, and scalability. It features authentication with session persistence, role-based access (user/admin), protected routes, and dynamic UI behavior based on user state. A responsive landing page with featured communities provides an engaging preview experience while restricting access to core features for unauthenticated users.

Built using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, Discussify follows modular component architecture, reusable UI components, and clean state management using React Context. Bootstrap and custom CSS are used to maintain a consistent design system and responsive layout. Backend APIs handle authentication, community management, discussions, resource sharing, and admin moderation with proper validation and error handling.
